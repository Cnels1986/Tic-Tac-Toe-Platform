This project will consist of three different parts that will hopefully interact and work together
once everything is complete:

### Tic Tac Toe: 
This is the game itself. Two players will be able to play against one another, their results will be stored within a database. If time allows a computer/bot will be added so players can play against it.

### Dashboard: 
  This will be where the data from the database will be     displayed (win/loss %, leaderboards, etc). Users will login into this to allow them to play the game. Will contain a lobby set up where users can select who they want to play based on who's logged in.

### Chat: 
This will be a chat feature that will be implemented within the game itself. It will allow players to communicate with one another.
